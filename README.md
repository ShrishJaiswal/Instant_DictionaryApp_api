# Instant_DictionaryApp_api
API for Dictionary Application

This is a rest-api for the dictionary application. 
1) The api is build using definition.py and dictionary.csv files from Instant Dictionary Project.
2) The api can be used in any of the project by just adding importing "request" module and giving the web-address of the api file.
3) Currently the api is hosted locally on a machine
4) For creating a web-interface, I used "justpy" framework which is one of the most popular framework in python for front-end web development.
5) The Documentation contains all the necessary details regarding the api.

The definition.py and dictionary.csv are 2 files which were used from Instant Dictionary project. Definition.py is a python file used for retrieval of definition of word
and dictionary.csv is a dataset in dictionary-format having {"words":"definition"} as key-value pairs. This dataset is open-source and Credit to Manas Sharma for providing
such a useful dataset. https://www.bragitoff.com/2016/03/english-dictionary-in-csv-format/.

The API is simple and can be modified for future usage and application.
